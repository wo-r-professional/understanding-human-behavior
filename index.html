                    Psychology is honestly one of the coolest subjects to explore because it helps us understand
                    everything about how people think, feel, and act. It's like diving into the mind and figuring out
                    what makes us tick. In this 3-week project, we're going to tackle a few key topics in psychology:
                    lifespan development, learning theories, memory, and intelligence. We'll dig into the big questions
                    and find out how these topics show up in everyday life. Plus, I get to present my findings in a
                    special way through website building!

                    Let's get into the key questions we'll be exploring during this project. These are the questions
                    that guide our research and thinking:

                    How Does Lifespan Development Affect Behavior?
                </h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    The first question is about how growing up and getting older affects the way we act and interact
                    with others. Lifespan development looks at all the stages of life, from childhood to old age, and
                    how each stage brings its own challenges and experiences that shape who we are.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    As we grow, our behavior changes in response to our experiences, relationships, and priorities.
                    Here's how it looks at different stages:
                </p>
                <ol class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2 flex flex-col gap-2">
                    <li><strong>Childhood:</strong> We learn how to interact with others by playing with friends and
                        learning social rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adolescence:</strong> This is the time for figuring out who we are. Peer pressure,
                        school, and even our first job can all shape how we behave.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adulthood:</strong> As we get older, we deal with new responsibilities, like work and
                        family. Our social interactions change a lot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aging:</strong> Older adults often become more reflective about life and tend to value
                        relationships and experiences more than material things.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    Basically, as we grow up, we change our behavior, the way we interact with others, and how we see
                    the world around us. It's a process that happens throughout life.

                    The Different Ways We Learn
                </h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    Another big question we need to dive into is how we learn: <span class="font-black">What are the
                        methods of conditioning, and how do learning theories explain these methods?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    Learning isn't just something that happens in school; it's happening all the time, whether we
                    realize it or not. There are a few well-known ways we learn: through classical conditioning, operant
                    conditioning, and observational learning.
                </p>
                <ol class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2 flex flex-col gap-2">
                    <li><strong>Classical Conditioning:</strong> This is learning by association. A classic example is
                        Pavlov's experiment with dogs. He rang a bell every time he fed them, and eventually, the dogs
                        started salivating just at the sound of the bell (even before the food came). This kind of
                        learning happens all around us, like when you hear a song and immediately think of a specific
                        memory.</li>

                    </div>
                    <li><strong>Operant Conditioning:</strong> This is learning through rewards and punishments. If you
                        do something that gets you a reward (like a treat or praise), you're more likely to do it again.
                        On the flip side, if you get punished for doing something, you'll probably avoid doing it in the
                        future. Think of training a dog: they learn to sit when they get a treat.</li>

                    </div>
                    <li><strong>Observational Learning:</strong> We can also learn by watching others. This is the basis
                        of observational learning theory by Albert Bandura. For example, kids often learn behaviors like how to
                        talk, walk, or even how to behave in certain situations just by watching their parents or peers.

                    These learning theories help us understand everything from how babies learn to talk to how we get
                    better at sports or schoolwork. It's pretty wild how much we can learn just by observing others or
                    experiencing rewards and punishments!

                    What's Going On Inside Our Heads (Biologically) When We Remember Stuff?
                </h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    Moving on to memory, let's explore another question: <span class="font-black">What biological
                        processes and disorders are related to memory?</span> Basically, what happens in our brains when
                    we remember something, and what happens when memory goes wrong?
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    Memory isn't just some magic trick our brain does. There are actual biological processes involved.
                    Here are a few:
                </p>
                <ol class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2 flex flex-col gap-2">
                    <li><strong>Synaptic Plasticity:</strong> This is the brain's ability to strengthen or weaken
                        connections between neurons based on experience. It's how we can form and store memories.</li>

                    Finally, let's tackle the big question about intelligence: <span class="font-black">How have

                    For years, intelligence has been measured through IQ tests, but that's only one way to measure it.

                        <p>So, as a kid, I was pretty rowdy - like, ADHD-level hyperactive. Honestly, I could never
                            sit still, which made school a nightmare. My grades were terrible, and I needed extra help like an
                            IEP. I barely tried to make friends, so I spent most of my elementary 
                            <!--START IMAGE-->
                            <div class="flex flex-col float-right pt-2 pl-2 pb-2">

                            years pretty lonely. But I was
                            active - did soccer at the start - and would always break the new toys I got, like, for no reason.
                            And I had this impulse control issue where if I thought of something random (like breaking a toy
                            car), I'd just go with it.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">Things got worse when I started hoarding food at the cafeteria. Yeah, that's right - I
                            started to gain a ton of weight. The ADHD meds didn't really help either, no matter how many patches
                            or pills I tried. My parents struggled with it, but I don't think they ever really understood what
                            was going on. And, honestly, I didn't either.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">But then, just before my last year of elementary school, something flipped. Out of
                            nowhere, I just stopped being a problem. My behavior changed, and I started getting better grades. I
                            made friends, barely got into trouble, and I stopped needing all the meds. Like, I just figured it
                            out. I know it sounds crazy, but that's how it happened. I felt like a new person. And here I am,
                            doing much better now.</p>
                        <p class="mt-2">In summary, I wasn't the easiest kid to raise, but my parents made sure I was taken care
                            of. They were always there for me. But I still struggled with socializing, which followed me into
                            middle school. I started with no friends, a bad rep, and I felt like I missed out on so much. Still,
                            it got better over time. So, what did I learn from Erik Erikson's stages?</p>

                        they trusted me to sort things out. That trust made me feel like I could handle things with
                        their support.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-black">Autonomy vs. Shame/Doubt</span>: Honestly, I didn't have much control
                        over my actions as a kid. Even when I knew what I was doing was wrong (like stealing from the
                        Scholastic book fair), I'd just do it. I never thought about consequences.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-black">Initiative vs. Guilt</span>: I never took any initiative. I was always
                        doing my own thing, ignoring instructions. Getting in trouble didn't bother me much either - I'd
                        just apologize and move on.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-black">Industry vs. Inferiority</span>: I thought I was the best at
                        everything, even when I wasn't. I remember trying to impress some kids by throwing a rock - and
                        hitting a car. Total fail. But I didn't feel inferior. I was too busy thinking I was amazing.

                    <p class="mt-2">In my case, after I graduated elementary school, I had this weird “snap” in my

                        into someone who cared more about school and
                        had a better attitude. Middle school was a huge improvement. My grades were better, I made friends,
                        and I finally understood how to handle schoolwork. I stopped doing all the stuff that got me into
                        trouble in elementary school. It was like the switch flipped. </p>
                    <p class="mt-2">Still, high school wasn't perfect. Freshman year was tough because I didn't care much
                        about getting good grades. But by sophomore year, everything fell into place. I learned to focus and
                        control my actions. I turned into a much more normal, “average” student. That was honestly a huge
                        win for me.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">In summary: I regained a lot of the qualities I missed during childhood. My ability to
                        focus improved, I became less selfish, and I started caring about others more - even animals! I
                        learned how to trust teachers and accept authority. The snap' really saved my life. Without it, I

                <h4 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-xl">Erik Erikson's Psychosocial Stages</h4>
                <p class="mt-2">Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development is one of the most well-known
                    frameworks for understanding human development. Erikson proposed that we face different psychosocial
                    challenges at various stages of our lives. Successful resolution of each challenge results in
                    personal growth and the development of virtues. Here is a brief look at each stage:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Trust vs. Mistrust:</strong> Infants learn to trust their caregivers and the world
                        around them when their needs are consistently met.</li>
                    <li><strong>Autonomy vs. Shame/Doubt:</strong> Toddlers develop independence and confidence through
                        exploration, or they may experience doubt in their abilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initiative vs. Guilt:</strong> Preschoolers take initiative and engage in creative
                        activities but may feel guilty if their attempts are discouraged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Industry vs. Inferiority:</strong> School-age children develop a sense of competence and
                        pride through success in school and other activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identity vs. Role Confusion:</strong> Adolescents explore their identity and values,
                        seeking a clear sense of self, or they may feel confused about their role in life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intimacy vs. Isolation:</strong> Young adults form close, meaningful relationships, or
                        experience loneliness and isolation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generativity vs. Stagnation:</strong> Adults strive to contribute to society and future
                        generations or feel stagnation and lack of purpose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrity vs. Despair:</strong> Older adults reflect on their lives, seeking meaning and
                        satisfaction or feeling regret and despair.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-xl">Jean Piaget's Cognitive Development</h4>
                <p class="mt-2">Jean Piaget's theory outlines how children's thinking evolves through distinct stages.
                    His theory emphasizes cognitive structures, which enable children to understand and interpret the
                    world. The stages include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Sensorimotor Stage:</strong> Infants explore the world using their senses and motor
                        actions, developing object permanence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preoperational Stage:</strong> Children use symbols and language but struggle with
                        logical reasoning and are egocentric in their thinking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Concrete Operational Stage:</strong> Children begin to think logically about concrete
                        events and understand concepts like conservation and classification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Formal Operational Stage:</strong> Adolescents develop the ability to think abstractly,
                        logically, and systematically about hypothetical situations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-xl">Lev Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory</h4>
                <p class="mt-2">Lev Vygotsky emphasized the role of social interaction and cultural context in cognitive
                    development. He argued that learning is collaborative, with more experienced individuals guiding a
                    child's learning process. Key concepts include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
                    <li><strong>Social Interaction & Learning:</strong> Children learn best through interactions with
                        more knowledgeable individuals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Tools & Artifacts:</strong> Cultural elements, such as language, writing, and
                        technology, shape how people think and learn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Language & Thought:</strong> Vygotsky believed that language is not just a communication
                        tool but also a means to organize thoughts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD):</strong> The ZPD refers to tasks a child can perform
                        with help, which are beyond their current independent abilities but achievable with guidance.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Scaffolding:</strong> Temporary support provided by a more knowledgeable person to help
                        a learner achieve a task within their ZPD.</li>
                    <li><strong>More Knowledgeable Other (MKO):</strong> The MKO is anyone who provides guidance, such
                        as teachers, parents, or peers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Development as Socially Mediated:</strong> Vygotsky argued that cognitive
                        development is deeply rooted in social interactions and cultural influences.</li>

                    associated with a stimulus that naturally produces a response. Over time, the neutral stimulus
                    starts to evoke the same response on its own.</p>

                <p class="mt-2">In Pavlov's famous experiment, he conditioned dogs to salivate in response to a neutral
                    stimulus (a bell) by repeatedly pairing it with food. Over time, the sound of the bell alone would
                    cause the dogs to salivate, even without the presence of food.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">This made me think of my own childhood. I used to rush downstairs whenever I heard the
                    front door open because my dad always brought food home. The sound of the door became a “trigger”
                    for food. Even after he stopped bringing food, I still ran downstairs whenever I heard the door
                    open, just like Pavlov's experiment in real life!</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5 font-black text-3xl">Operant Conditioning</h3>
                <p class="mt-2">Operant conditioning is a type of learning where behavior is controlled by consequences
                    (reinforcement or punishment).</p>

                <p class="mt-2">In Skinner's experiment, he placed rats in a box where they could receive food for
                    pressing a lever or button. This positive reinforcement strengthened the behavior of pressing the
                    lever, encouraging the rats to repeat the action.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">This concept reminds me of when I used to mow the lawn for money. I was motivated by the
                    reward (money), but once winter came and I couldn't mow anymore, I lost interest. The
                    “reinforcement” worked as long as the reward was present, just like Skinner's experiment.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-5 font-black text-3xl">Observational Learning Theory</h3>
                <p class="mt-2">Observational learning theory suggests that people can learn by observing others, especially in
                    social contexts, without direct reinforcement or punishment. People tend to imitate behaviors they
                    see around them.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">In Bandura's experiment, children who watched an adult behaving aggressively toward a
                    Bobo doll were more likely to imitate that behavior, even when there was no reinforcement involved.
                    This shows that learning can occur through observation alone.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">This theory resonates with my own experience in high school. Early on, I was very
                    positive about my school, New Tech High School (NTHS), and the band program. However, after spending
                    time with older students who had negative views about the school, I began to imitate their opinions
                    and started to dislike NTHS. Over time, I realized that my perspective was influenced by the people
                    around me, and after changing my focus to programming, I gained a more positive view of the school.

                    all the time. Pavlov's classical conditioning, Skinner's operant conditioning, and Bandura's social
                    learning theory are all relevant in everyday life. Whether it's training a pet (classical
                    conditioning), rewarding children for tasks (operant conditioning), or people imitating behaviors
                    they see in others (observational learning), these principles shape how we learn from our environment.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-2xl">Hippocampus:</h3>
                <p class="text-lg">Located in the medial temporal lobe, plays an important role in forming new memories,
                    including declarative memory (memories that can be consciously recalled). Damage to the hippocampus
                    can impair the ability to form new long-term memories, a condition often observed in patients with
                    Alzheimer's disease.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-2xl">Amygdala:</h3>
                <p class="text-lg">Associated with the processing of emotions and plays a role in memory, especially
                    emotional memory. It is involved in strengthening memories that have strong emotional components.

                <ol class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2 flex flex-col gap-2">
                    <li><span class="font-black">IQ Tests (Intelligence Quotient):</span> IQ tests are among the most
                        widely used measures of intelligence. They aim to quantify cognitive abilities through
                        standardized testing. These tests typically measure skills like logical reasoning, mathematical
                        ability, language comprehension, and spatial visualization.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-black">Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences:</span> Howard Gardner
                        proposed that intelligence is not a single entity but rather a set of distinct independent
                        abilities. His theory includes at least eight types of intelligences:
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
                            <li>Linguistic</li>
                            <li>Logical-mathematical</li>
                            <li>Spatial</li>
                            <li>Musical</li>
                            <li>Bodily-kinesthetic</li>

                            <li>Intrapersonal</li>
                            <li>Naturalistic</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="font-black">Cultural Perspectives on Intelligence:</span> Intelligence is
                        culturally defined and can vary across different societies. In some cultures, social
                        intelligence such as the ability to navigate complex social hierarchies is highly valued, while
                        in others, academic achievements and logical reasoning are prioritized.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-2xl">Compare Historical and Contemporary Views on Intelligence</h3>
                <p class="mt-3 text-lg">Intelligence has been seen as a single, general trait (g-factor) that determines
                    a person's cognitive abilities. The concept of general intelligence was popularized by Charles
                    Spearman in the early 20th century. He argued that people who perform well on one cognitive task
                    tend to perform well on others, suggesting a general cognitive ability.</p>
                <p class="mt-3 text-lg">In contrast, contemporary theories such as Gardner's multiple intelligences and
                    Sternberg's triarchic theory offer a broader view of intelligence. Sternberg's theory suggests that
                    intelligence consists of three aspects:
                <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
                    <li>Analytical Intelligence</li>
                    <li>Creative Intelligence</li>
                    <li>Practical Intelligence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These modern theories reflect a shift away from a narrow, standardized view of intelligence toward a
                    more inclusive and dynamic understanding of cognitive abilities.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-2xl">Societal Values and Intelligence</h3>
                <p class="mt-3 text-lg">The way intelligence is defined and measured often reflects societal values. For
                    instance, in an increasingly globalized world, there is a growing recognition of the value of
                    diverse cognitive skills, such as emotional intelligence, social intelligence, and creativity.
                    However, traditional measures like IQ tests still dominate educational and professional settings in
                    many parts of the world, emphasizing logical reasoning and analytical thinking over other types of
                    intelligence. This has led to debates about whether these tests truly reflect an individual's
                    potential and capabilities.</p>
