# About the project
This is a psychology project focused on understanding human behavior through a three-week process of research and the creation of a presentation to present that research. This is the presentation.

## Smaller details
* The design is based off [nature.com](https://nature.com/).
* Just about any links including things from the Navbar or footer are NOT INTERACTABLE. The website does inform you about this if you visit it for the first time.
* This was not made my a pro, even if its pretty good anyways still. But again don't make fun of others work. It was about a 2 week process to make the whole thing from start to finish, while also finishing the research for the entire project.

With that, I hope you enjoy my project!
